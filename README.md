The problem at hand revolves around comprehensively analyzing the phenomenon of employee attrition within Company XYZ. Employee attrition, the process of employees voluntarily leaving the organization, poses significant challenges to organizational stability, productivity, and growth. By investigating the underlying causes, patterns, and implications of attrition, Company XYZ aims to develop strategic interventions to mitigate attrition rates and foster a more stable and thriving workforce environment.

# Solution Approach:
To address the problem statement, the following approach was used:

# * Data Import and Initial Analysis:
The recorded data was provided in a CSV file was imported. Initial insights were drawn from the data to gain a preliminary understanding of the causes of attrition.

# * Data Modeling and Relationship Creation:
Data modeling is performed within Power BI to create relationships between the relevant tables. This step ensures that the data could be properly analyzed and visualized.
Here in this case as the file conained a single table, it did not require any extra step to create any relationship.

# * Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Power BI's data transformation features, such as Power Query, were utilized to clean and transform the data. Irrelevant entries, duplicates, and inconsistencies were removed or resolved, ensuring the data was accurate and reliable. Also some new colums were introduced for simplification of data.

# * Dashboard Creation:
The created dashboard shows fields like 'Total Attrition', 'Attrition Rate', 'Average Working Years', 'Average Monthly Salary' etc KPIs. It also shows 'Attrition by Age Group', 'Attrition by Salary Slab', 'Attrition by Job Role', 'Attrition by Department'.
